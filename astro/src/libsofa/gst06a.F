*  Greenwich apparent sidereal time (consistent with IAU 2000 and 2006
*  resolutions).
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     UTA, UTB     d      UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
*     TTA, TTB     d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_GST06A   d      Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 and TT dates UTA+UTB and TTA+TTB respectively, are both
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
*     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
*     any of these ways, among others:
*
*            Part A         Part B
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
*     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
*     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
*     rotation angle routine, called internally:  maximum accuracy (or,
*     at least, minimum noise) is delivered when the UTA argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the UTB argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
*     and TT to predict the effects of precession-nutation.  If UT1 is
*     used for both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds
*     result.
*
*  3) This GAST is compatible with the IAU 2000/2006 resolutions and
*     must be used only in conjunction with IAU 2006 precession and
*     IAU 2000A nutation.
*
*  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_PNM06A   classical NPB matrix, IAU 2006/2000A
*     iau_GST06    Greenwich apparent ST, IAU 2006, given NPB matrix
