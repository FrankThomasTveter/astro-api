*
*  Form the celestial to terrestrial matrix given the date, the UT1 and
*  the polar motion, using the IAU 2000B nutation model.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     TTA,TTB    d       TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*     UTA,UTB    d       UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*     XP,YP      d       coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 2)
*
*  Returned:
*     RC2T     d(3,3)    celestial-to-terrestrial matrix (Note 3)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT and UT1 dates TTA+TTB and UTA+UTB are Julian Dates,
*     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments UTA and
*     UTB.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
*     these ways, among others:
*
*             UTA            UTB
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of UTA,UTB, the
*     date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
*     algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at least, minimum noise) is
*     delivered when the UTA argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
*     question and the UTB argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
*     versa.
*
*  2) XP and YP are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*     meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.
*
*  3) The matrix RC2T transforms from celestial to terrestrial
*     coordinates:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
*
*               =  RC2T * [CRS]
*
*     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RC2I is the
*     celestial-to-intermediate matrix, ERA is the Earth rotation angle
*     and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
*
*  4) The present routine is faster, but slightly less accurate (about
*     1 mas), than the iau_C2T00A routine.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_C2I00B   celestial-to-intermediate matrix, IAU 2000B
*     iau_ERA00    Earth rotation angle, IAU 2000
*     iau_POM00    polar motion matrix
*     iau_C2TCIO   form CIO-based celestial-to-terrestrial matrix
