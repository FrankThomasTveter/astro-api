*
*  Form the celestial-to-intermediate matrix for a given date given
*  the bias-precession-nutation matrix.  IAU 2000.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2    d       TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*     RBPN         d(3,3)    celestial-to-true matrix (Note 2)
*
*  Returned:
*     RC2I         d(3,3)    celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 3)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The matrix RBPN transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator (and
*     CIO or equinox) of date.  Only the CIP (bottom row) is used.
*
*  3) The matrix RC2I is the first stage in the transformation from
*     celestial to terrestrial coordinates:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
*
*               =  RC2T * [CRS]
*
*     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
*     Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
*
*  4) Although its name does not include "00", this routine is in fact
*     specific to the IAU 2000 models.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_BPN2XY   extract CIP X,Y coordinates from NPB matrix
*     iau_C2IXY    celestial-to-intermediate matrix, given X,Y
