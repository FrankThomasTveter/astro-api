*  - - - - - - - - - - -
*
*  Form the celestial to intermediate-frame-of-date matrix given the CIP
*  X,Y and the CIO locator s.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     X,Y        d       Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 1)
*     S          d       the CIO locator s (Note 2)
*
*  Returned:
*     RC2I     d(3,3)    celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 3)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y components
*     of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System.
*
*  2) The CIO locator s (in radians) positions the Celestial
*     Intermediate Origin on the equator of the CIP.
*
*  3) The matrix RC2I is the first stage in the transformation from
*     celestial to terrestrial coordinates:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
*
*               =  RC2T * [CRS]
*
*     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
*     Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_IR       initialize r-matrix to identity
*     iau_RZ       rotate around Z-axis
*     iau_RY       rotate around Y-axis

*     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
*     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
*     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
*     with the following requirements:
*
*     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
*        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
*        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
*        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
*        endorsed by SOFA.
*
*     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
*        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
*        from the original SOFA software.
*
*     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
*        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
*        thereof such as changes of case.
*
*     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
*        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
*        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
*        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
*
*     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
*        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
*        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
