*
*  Position-angle from two p-vectors.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  vector/matrix support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     A        d(3)      direction of reference point
*     B        d(3)      direction of point whose PA is required
*
*  Returned:
*     THETA    d         position angle of B with respect to A (radians)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The result is the position angle, in radians, of direction B with
*     respect to direction A.  It is in the range -pi to +pi.  The sense
*     is such that if B is a small distance "north" of A the position
*     angle is approximately zero, and if B is a small distance "east" of
*     A the position angle is approximately +pi/2.
*
*  2) A and B need not be unit vectors.
*
*  3) Zero is returned if the two directions are the same or if either
*     vector is null.
*
*  4) If A is at a pole, the result is ill-defined.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_PN       decompose p-vector into modulus and direction
*     iau_PM       modulus of p-vector
*     iau_PXP      vector product of two p-vectors
*     iau_PMP      p-vector minus p-vector
*     iau_PDP      scalar product of two p-vectors
