*
*  Quick ICRS, epoch J2000.0, to CIRS transformation, given precomputed
*  star-independent astrometry parameters plus a list of light-
*  deflecting bodies.
*
*  Use of this routine is appropriate when efficiency is important and
*  where many star positions are to be transformed for one date.  The
*  star-independent parameters can be obtained by calling one of the
*  routines iau_APCI[13], iau_APCG[13], iau_APCO[13] or iau_APCS[13].
*
*  If the only light-deflecting body to be taken into account is the
*  Sun, the iau_ATCIQ routine can be used instead.  If in addition the
*  parallax and proper motions are zero, the iau_ATCIQZ routine can be
*  used.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     RC,DC    d      ICRS RA,Dec at J2000.0 (radians, Note 1)
*     PR       d      RA proper motion (radians/year; Note 2)
*     PD       d      Dec proper motion (radians/year)
*     PX       d      parallax (arcsec)
*     RV       d      radial velocity (km/s, +ve if receding)

*               (8)      distance from Sun to observer (au)
*               (9-11)   v: barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
*               (12)     sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
*               (13-21)  bias-precession-nutation matrix
*               (22)     longitude + s' (radians)
*               (23)     polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
*               (24)     polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
*               (25)     sine of geodetic latitude
*               (26)     cosine of geodetic latitude
*               (27)     magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
*               (28)     "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
*               (29)     refraction constant A (radians)
*               (30)     refraction constant B (radians)
*     N        i       number of bodies (Note 3)
*     B        d(8,N)  data for each of the NB bodies (Notes 3,4):
*               (1,I)    mass of the body (solar masses, Note 5)
*               (2,I)    deflection limiter (Note 6)
*               (3-5,I)  barycentric position of the body (au)
*               (6-8,I)  barycentric velocity of the body (au/day)
*
*  Returned:
*     RI,DI    d      CIRS RA,Dec (radians)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) Star data for an epoch other than J2000.0 (for example from the
*     Hipparcos catalog, which has an epoch of J1991.25) will require a
*     preliminary call to iau_PMSAFE before use.
*
*  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
*
*  3) The array B contains N entries, one for each body to be
*     considered.  If N = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
*     applied, not even for the Sun.
*
*  4) The array B should include an entry for the Sun as well as for any
*     planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries should
*     be in the order in which the light passes the body.
*
*  5) In the entry in the B array for body I, the mass parameter B(1,I)
*     can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such effects
*     as quadrupole field.
*
*  6) The deflection limiter parameter B(2,I) is phi^2/2, where phi is
*     the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at which
*     limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen threshold,
*     the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero for phi = 0.
*     Example values suitable for a terrestrial observer, together with
*     masses, are as follows:
*
*        body I     B(1,I)         B(2,I)
*
*        Sun        1D0            6D-6
*        Jupiter    0.00095435D0   3D-9
*        Saturn     0.00028574D0   3D-10
*
*  7) For efficiency, validation of the B array is omitted.  The
*     supplied masses must be greater than zero, the position and
*     velocity vectors must be right, and the deflection limiter
*     greater than zero.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_PMPX     proper motion and parallax
*     iau_LDN      light deflection by n bodies
*     iau_AB       stellar aberration
*     iau_RXP      product of r-matrix and pv-vector
*     iau_C2S      p-vector to spherical
*     iau_ANP      normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
