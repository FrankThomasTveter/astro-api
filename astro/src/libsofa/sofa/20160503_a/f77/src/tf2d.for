*
*  Convert hours, minutes, seconds to days.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     S          c      sign:  '-' = negative, otherwise positive
*     IHOUR      i      hours
*     IMIN       i      minutes
*     SEC        d      seconds
*
*  Returned:
*     DAYS       d      interval in days
*     J          i      status:  0 = OK
*                                1 = IHOUR outside range 0-23
*                                2 = IMIN outside range 0-59
*                                3 = SEC outside range 0-59.999...
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  If the s argument is a string, only the leftmost character is
*      used and no warning status is provided.
*
*  2)  The result is computed even if any of the range checks fail.
*
*  3)  Negative IHOUR, IMIN and/or SEC produce a warning status, but the
*      absolute value is used in the conversion.
*
*  4)  If there are multiple errors, the status value reflects only the
*      first, the smallest taking precedence.

*     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
*     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
*     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
*     with the following requirements:
*
*     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
*        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
*        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
*        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
*        endorsed by SOFA.
*
*     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
*        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
*        from the original SOFA software.
*
*     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
*        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
*        thereof such as changes of case.
*
*     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
*        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
*        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
*        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
*
*     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
*        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
*        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
*        derived work.
*
*     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
*     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
*     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
*     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
*     such, as explained above.
*
*  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
*     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
*     by inappropriate modification.
