*  Julian Date to Gregorian year, month, day, and fraction of a day.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     DJ1,DJ2     d     Julian Date (Notes 1, 2)
*
*  Returned:
*     IY          i     year
*     IM          i     month
*     ID          i     day
*     FD          d     fraction of day
*     J           i     status:
*                           0 = OK
*                          -1 = unacceptable date (Note 3)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The earliest valid date is -68569.5 (-4900 March 1).  The
*     largest value accepted is 10^9.
*
*  2) The Julian Date is apportioned in any convenient way between
*     the arguments DJ1 and DJ2.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could
*     be expressed in any of these ways, among others:
*
*             DJ1            DJ2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*  3) In early eras the conversion is from the "Proleptic Gregorian
*     Calendar";  no account is taken of the date(s) of adoption of
*     the Gregorian Calendar, nor is the AD/BC numbering convention
*     observed.
