*
*  Quick ICRS to CIRS transformation, given precomputed star-independent
*  astrometry parameters, and assuming zero parallax and proper motion.
*
*  Use of this routine is appropriate when efficiency is important and
*  where many star positions are to be transformed for one date.  The
*  star-independent parameters can be obtained by calling one of the
*  routines iau_APCI[13], iau_APCG[13], iau_APCO[13] or iau_APCS[13].
*
*  The corresponding routine for the case of non-zero parallax and
*  proper motion is iau_ATCIQ.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     RC,DC    d      ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)
*     ASTROM   d(30)  star-independent astrometry parameters:
*               (1)      PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)
*               (2-4)    SSB to observer (vector, au)
*               (5-7)    Sun to observer (unit vector)
*               (8)      distance from Sun to observer (au)
*               (9-11)   v: barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
*               (12)     sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
*               (13-21)  bias-precession-nutation matrix
*               (22)     longitude + s' (radians)
*               (23)     polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
*               (24)     polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
*               (25)     sine of geodetic latitude
*               (26)     cosine of geodetic latitude
*               (27)     magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
*               (28)     "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
*               (29)     refraction constant A (radians)
*               (30)     refraction constant B (radians)
*
*  Returned:
*     RI,DI    d      CIRS RA,Dec (radians)
*
*  Note:
*
*     All the vectors are with respect to BCRS axes.
