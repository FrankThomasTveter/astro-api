*     ASTROM   d(30)  star-independent astrometry parameters:
*               (1)      unchanged
*               (2-4)    unchanged
*               (5-7)    unchanged
*               (8)      unchanged
*               (9-11)   unchanged
*               (12)     unchanged

*               (28)     "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
*               (29)     unchanged
*               (30)     unchanged
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) This routine exists to enable sidereal-tracking applications to
*     avoid wasteful recomputation of the bulk of the astrometry
*     parameters:  only the Earth rotation is updated.
*
*  2) For targets expressed as equinox based positions, such as
*     classical geocentric apparent (RA,Dec), the supplied THETA can be
*     Greenwich apparent sidereal time rather than Earth rotation
*     angle.
*
*  3) The routine iau_APER13 can be used instead of the present routine,
*     and starts from UT1 rather than ERA itself.
*
*  4) This is one of several routines that inserts into the ASTROM
*     array star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
*     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
*
*     The various routines support different classes of observer and
*     portions of the transformation chain:
*
*            routines           observer        transformation
*
*        iau_APCG iau_APCG13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
*        iau_APCI iau_APCI13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
*        iau_APCO iau_APCO13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
*        iau_APCS iau_APCS13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
*        iau_APER iau_APER13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
*        iau_APIO iau_APIO13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
*
*     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
*     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
*     supplied by the caller.
*
*     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
*     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
*     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
*     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
*     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
*     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
