*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 date (n.b. not UTC) UT11+UT12 is a Julian Date,
*     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments UT11 and
*     UT12.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any
*     of these ways, among others:
*
*            UT11           UT12
*
*         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
*         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
*         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
*     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum precision is
*     delivered when the UT11 argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
*     question and the UT12 argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
*     versa.
*
*  2) If the caller wishes to provide the Earth rotation angle itself,
*     the routine iau_APER can be used instead.  One use of this
*     technique is to substitute Greenwich apparent sidereal time and
*     thereby to support equinox based transformations directly.
*
*  3) This is one of several routines that inserts into the ASTROM
*     array star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
*     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
*
*     The various routines support different classes of observer and
*     portions of the transformation chain:
*
*            routines           observer        transformation
*
*        iau_APCG iau_APCG13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
*        iau_APCI iau_APCI13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
*        iau_APCO iau_APCO13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
*        iau_APCS iau_APCS13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
*        iau_APER iau_APER13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
*        iau_APIO iau_APIO13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
*
*     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
*     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
*     supplied by the caller.
*
*     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
*     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
*     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
*     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
*     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
*     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
