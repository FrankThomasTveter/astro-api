*  Observed place to CIRS.  The caller supplies UTC, site coordinates,
*  ambient air conditions and observing wavelength.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     TYPE     c*(*)  type of coordinates - 'R', 'H' or 'A' (Notes 1,2)
*     OB1      d      observed Az, HA or RA (radians; Az is N=0,E=90)
*     OB2      d      observed ZD or Dec (radians)
*     UTC1     d      UTC as a 2-part...
*     UTC2     d      ...quasi Julian Date (Notes 3,4)
*     DUT1     d      UT1-UTC (seconds, Note 5)
*     ELONG    d      longitude (radians, east +ve, Note 6)
*     PHI      d      geodetic latitude (radians, Note 6)
*     HM       d      height above the ellipsoid (meters, Notes 6,8)
*     XP,YP    d      polar motion coordinates (radians, Note 7)
*     PHPA     d      pressure at the observer (hPa = mB, Note 8)
*     TC       d      ambient temperature at the observer (deg C)
*     RH       d      relative humidity at the observer (range 0-1)
*     WL       d      wavelength (micrometers, Note 9)
*
*  Returned:
*     RI       d      CIRS right ascension (CIO-based, radians)
*     DI       d      CIRS declination (radians)
*     J        i      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 2)
*                              0 = OK
*                             -1 = unacceptable date
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
*      perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is
*      used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
*      allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is
*      related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
*      the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
*      observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
*      angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
*      means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
*      with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.
*
*  2)  Only the first character of the TYPE argument is significant.
*      'R' or 'r' indicates that OB1 and OB2 are the observed right
*      ascension and declination;  'H' or 'h' indicates that they are
*      hour angle (west +ve) and declination;  anything else ('A' or
*      'a' is recommended) indicates that OB1 and OB2 are azimuth
*      (north zero, east 90 deg) and zenith distance.
*
*  3)  UTC1+UTC2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
*      convenient way between the two arguments, for example where UTC1
*      is the Julian Day Number and UTC2 is the fraction of a day.
*
*      However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
*      second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
*      present routine is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
*      the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
*
*      Applications should use the routine iau_DTF2D to convert from
*      calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
*      it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
*      described.
*
*  4)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*      introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
*      future to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
*
*  5)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
*      one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
*      introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
*      practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
*      essentially without limit.
*
*  6)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*      reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
*      longitude required by the present routine is east-positive
*      (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
*
*  7)  The polar motion XP,YP can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
*      values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*      Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*      Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*      meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
*      XP and YP can be set to zero.
*
*  8)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
*      in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
*      available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
*      expression
*
*            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );
*
*      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
*      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
*      52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
*      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
*      follows:
*
*            phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
*
*      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
*      the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
*      precise work.
*
*  9)  The argument WL specifies the observing wavelength in
*      micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
*      occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).
*
*  10) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
*      refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
*      Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
*      there are no gross local effects, the predicted astrometric
*      coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
*      (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
*      than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
*      than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
*
*      Without refraction, the complementary routines iau_ATIO13 and
*      iau_ATOI13 are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond
*      all over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included,
*      consistency falls off at high zenith distances, but is still
*      better than 0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.
*
*  11) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
*      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*      accordance with the models used.
