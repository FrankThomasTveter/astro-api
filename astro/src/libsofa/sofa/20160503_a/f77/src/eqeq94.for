*  Equation of the equinoxes, IAU 1994 model.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2     d         TDB date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_EQEQ94      d         equation of the equinoxes (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
*     others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:
*
*        Greenwich apparent ST = GMST + equation of the equinoxes
*
*  Called:
*     iau_ANPM     normalize angle into range +/- pi
*     iau_NUT80    nutation, IAU 1980
*     iau_OBL80    mean obliquity, IAU 1980
