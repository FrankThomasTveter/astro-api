                  -------------------------------
                  THE IAU-SOFA SOFTWARE LIBRARIES
                  -------------------------------


  SOFA stands for "Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy".  The SOFA
  software libraries are a collection of subprograms, in source-
  code form, which implement official IAU algorithms for fundamental-
  astronomy computations.   The subprograms at present comprise 176
  "astronomy" routines supported by 55 "vector/matrix" routines,
  available in both Fortran77 and C implementations.


THE SOFA INITIATIVE

SOFA is an IAU Service which operates as a Standing Working Group under
Division A (Fundamental Astronomy).

The IAU set up the SOFA initiative at the 1994 General Assembly, to
promulgate an authoritative set of fundamental-astronomy constants and
algorithms.  At the subsequent General Assembly, in 1997, the
appointment of a review board and the selection of a site for the SOFA
Center (the outlet for SOFA products) were announced.

The SOFA initiative was originally proposed by the IAU Working Group on
Astronomical Standards (WGAS), under the chairmanship of
Toshio Fukushima.  The proposal was for "...new arrangements to
establish and maintain an accessible and authoritative set of constants,
algorithms and procedures that implement standard models used in
fundamental astronomy".  The SOFA Software Libraries implement the
"algorithms" part of the SOFA initiative.  They were developed under the
supervision of an international panel called the SOFA Board.  The
current membership of this panel is listed in an appendix.

A feature of the original SOFA software proposals was that the products
would be self-contained and not depend on other software.  This includes
basic documentation, which, like the present file, will mostly be plain
ASCII text.  It should also be noted that there is no assumption that
the software will be used on a particular computer and Operating System.
Although OS-related facilities may be present (Unix make files for
instance, use by the SOFA Center of automatic code management systems,
HTML versions of some documentation), the routines themselves will be
visible as individual text files and will run on a variety of platforms.


ALGORITHMS

The SOFA Board's initial goal has been to create a set of callable
subprograms.  Whether "subroutines" or "functions", they are all
referred to simply as "routines".  They are designed for use by software
developers wishing to write complete applications;  no runnable, free-
standing applications are included in SOFA's present plans.

The algorithms are drawn from a variety of sources.  Because most of the
routines so far developed have either been standard "text-book"
operations or implement well-documented standard algorithms, it has not
been necessary to invite the whole community to submit algorithms,
though consultation with authorities has occurred where necessary.  It
should also be noted that consistency with the conventions published by
the International Earth Rotation Service was a stipulation in the
original SOFA proposals, further constraining the software designs.
This state of affairs will continue to exist for some time, as there is
a large backlog of agreed extensions to work on.  However, in the future
the Board may decide to call for proposals, and is in the meantime
willing to look into any suggestions that are received by the SOFA
Center.


SCOPE

The routines currently available are listed in the next two chapters of
this document.

The "astronomy" library comprises 176 routines (plus one obsolete
Fortran routine that now appears under a revised name).  The areas
addressed include calendars, astrometry, time scales, Earth rotation,
ephemerides, precession-nutation, star catalog transformations,
and geodetic/geocentric transformations.

The "vector-matrix" library, comprising 55 routines, contains a
collection of simple tools for manipulating the vectors, matrices and
angles used by the astronomy routines.

There is no explicit commitment by SOFA to support historical models,
though as time goes on a legacy of superseded models will naturally
accumulate.  There is, for example, no support of B1950/FK4 star
coordinates, or pre-1976 precession models, though these capabilities
could be added were there significant demand.

Though the SOFA software libraries are rather limited in scope, and are
likely to remain so for a considerable time, they do offer distinct
advantages to prospective users.  In particular, the routines are:

  * authoritative:  they are IAU-backed and have been constructed with
    great care;

  * practical:  they are straightforward to use in spite of being
    precise and rigorous (to some stated degree);

  * accessible and supported: they are downloadable from an easy-to-
    find place, they are in an integrated and consistent form, they
    come with adequate internal documentation, and help for users is
    available.


VERSIONS

Once it has been published, an issue is never revised or updated, and
remains accessible indefinitely.  Subsequent issues may, however,
include corrected versions under the original routine name and
filenames.  However, where a different model is introduced, it will have
a different name.

The issues will be referred to by the date when they were announced.
The frequency of re-issue will be decided by the Board, taking into
account the importance of the changes and the impact on the user
community.


DOCUMENTATION

At present there is little free-standing documentation about individual
routines.  However, each routine has preamble comments which specify in
detail what the routine does and how it is used.

The files sofa_pn_f.pdf and sofa_pn_c.pdf (for Fortran and C users
respectively) describe the SOFA tools for precession-nutation
and other aspects of Earth attitude, and include example code and,
in an appendix, diagrams showing the interrelationships between the
routines supporting the latest (IAU 2006/2000A) models.  Two other pairs
of documents introduce time scale transformations (sofa_ts_f.pdf and
sofa_ts_c.pdf ) and astrometric transformations (sofa_ast_f.pdf and
sofa_ast_c.pdf).


PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND STANDARDS

The SOFA routines are available in two programming languages at present:
Fortran77 and ANSI C.  Related software in other languages is under
consideration.

The Fortran code conforms to ANSI X3.9-1978 in all but two minor
respects: each has an IMPLICIT NONE declaration, and its name has a
prefix of "iau_" and may be longer than 6 characters.  A global edit to
erase both of these will produce ANSI-compliant code with no change in
its function.

Coding style, and restrictions on the range of language features, have
been much debated by the Board, and the results comply with the majority
view.  There is (at present) no document that defines the standards, but
the code itself offers a wide range of examples of what is acceptable.

The Fortran routines contain explicit numerical constants (the INCLUDE
statement is not part of ANSI Fortran77).  These are drawn from the
file consts.lis, which is listed in an appendix.  Constants for the
SOFA/C functions are defined in a header file sofam.h.

The naming convention is such that a SOFA routine referred to
generically as "EXAMPL" exists as a Fortran subprogram iau_EXAMPL and a
C function iauExampl.  The calls for the two versions are very similar,
with the same arguments in the same order.  In a few cases, the C
equivalent of a Fortran SUBROUTINE subprogram uses a return value rather
than an argument.

Each language version includes a "testbed" main-program that can be used
to verify that the SOFA routines have been correctly compiled on the end
user's system.  The Fortran and C versions are called t_sofa_f.for and
t_sofa_c.c respectively.  The testbeds execute every SOFA routine and
check that the results are within expected accuracy margins.  It is not
possible to guarantee that all platforms will meet the rather stringent
criteria that have been used, and an occasional warning message may be
encountered on some systems.


COPYRIGHT ISSUES

Copyright for all of the SOFA software and documentation is owned by the
IAU SOFA Board.  The Software is made available free of charge for all
classes of user, including commercial.  However, there are strict rules
designed to avoid unauthorized variants coming into circulation.  It is
permissible to distribute derived works and other modifications, but
they must be clearly marked to avoid confusion with the SOFA originals.

Further details are included in the block of comments which concludes
every routine.  The text is also set out in an appendix to the present
document.


ACCURACY

The SOFA policy is to organize the calculations so that the machine
accuracy is fully exploited.  The gap between the precision of the
underlying model or theory and the computational resolution has to be
kept as large as possible, hopefully leaving several orders of
magnitude of headroom.

The SOFA routines in some cases involve design compromises between rigor
and ease of use (and also speed, though nowadays this is seldom a major
concern).


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Board is indebted to a number of contributors, who are acknowledged
in the preamble comments of the routines concerned.

The Board's effort is provided by the members' individual institutes.

Resources for operating the SOFA Center are provided by Her Majesty's
Nautical Almanac Office, operated by the United Kingdom Hydrographic
Office.

                     ----------------------
                     SOFA Astronomy Library
                     ----------------------


PREFACE

The routines described here comprise the SOFA astronomy library.  Their
general appearance and coding style conforms to conventions agreed by
the SOFA Board, and their functions, names and algorithms have been
ratified by the Board.  Procedures for soliciting and agreeing additions
to the library are still evolving.


PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The SOFA routines are available in two programming languages at present:
Fortran 77 and ANSI C.

Except for a single obsolete Fortran routine, which has no C equivalent,
there is a one-to-one relationship between the two language versions.
The naming convention is such that a SOFA routine referred to
generically as "EXAMPL" exists as a Fortran subprogram iau_EXAMPL and a
C function iauExampl.  The calls for the two versions are very similar,
with the same arguments in the same order.  In a few cases, the C
equivalent of a Fortran SUBROUTINE subprogram uses a return value rather
than an argument.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The principal function of the SOFA Astronomy Library is to provide
definitive algorithms.  A secondary function is to provide software
suitable for convenient direct use by writers of astronomical
applications.

The astronomy routines call on the SOFA vector/matrix library routines,
which are separately listed.

The routines are designed to exploit the full floating-point accuracy
of the machines on which they run, and not to rely on compiler
optimizations.  Within these constraints, the intention is that the code
corresponds to the published formulation (if any).

Dates are always Julian Dates (except in calendar conversion routines)
and are expressed as two double precision numbers which sum to the
required value.

A distinction is made between routines that implement IAU-approved
models and those that use those models to create other results.  The
former are referred to as "canonical models" in the preamble comments;
the latter are described as "support routines".

Using the library requires knowledge of positional astronomy and
time-scales.  These topics are covered in "Explanatory Supplement to the
Astronomical Almanac", 3rd Edition,  Sean E. Urban &
P. Kenneth Seidelmann (eds.), University Science Books, 2013.  Recent
developments are documented in the scientific journals, and references
to the relevant papers are given in the SOFA code as required.  The IERS
Conventions are also an essential reference.  The routines concerned
with Earth attitude (precession-nutation etc.) are described in the SOFA
document sofa_pn.pdf.  Those concerned with transformations between
different time scales are described in sofa_ts_f.pdf (Fortran) and
sofa_ts_c.pdf (C).  Those concerned with astrometric transformations
are described in sofa_ast_f.pdf (Fortran) and sofa_ast_c (C).

                   --------------------------
                   SOFA Vector/Matrix Library
                   --------------------------

PREFACE

The routines described here comprise the SOFA vector/matrix library.
Their general appearance and coding style conforms to conventions
agreed by the SOFA Board, and their functions, names and algorithms have
been ratified by the Board.  Procedures for soliciting and agreeing
additions to the library are still evolving.


PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The SOFA routines are available in two programming languages at present:
Fortran 77 and ANSI C.

There is a one-to-one relationship between the two language versions.
The naming convention is such that a SOFA routine referred to
generically as "EXAMPL" exists as a Fortran subprogram iau_EXAMPL and a
C function iauExampl.  The calls for the two versions are very similar,
with the same arguments in the same order.  In a few cases, the C
equivalent of a Fortran SUBROUTINE subprogram uses a return value rather
than an argument.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The library consists mostly of routines which operate on ordinary
Cartesian vectors (x,y,z) and 3x3 rotation matrices.  However, there is
also support for vectors which represent velocity as well as position
and vectors which represent rotation instead of position.  The vectors
which represent both position and velocity may be considered still to
have dimensions (3), but to comprise elements each of which is two
numbers, representing the value itself and the time derivative.  Thus:

* "Position" or "p" vectors (or just plain 3-vectors) have dimension
  (3) in Fortran and [3] in C.

* "Position/velocity" or "pv" vectors have dimensions (3,2) in Fortran
  and [2][3] in C.

* "Rotation" or "r" matrices have dimensions (3,3) in Fortran and [3][3]
  in C.  When used for rotation, they are "orthogonal";  the inverse of
  such a matrix is equal to the transpose.  Most of the routines in
  this library do not assume that r-matrices are necessarily orthogonal
  and in fact work on any 3x3 matrix.

* "Rotation" or "r" vectors have dimensions (3) in Fortran and [3] in C.
  Such vectors are a combination of the Euler axis and angle and are
  convertible to and from r-matrices.  The direction is the axis of
  rotation and the magnitude is the angle of rotation, in radians.
  Because the amount of rotation can be scaled up and down simply by
  multiplying the vector by a scalar, r-vectors are useful for
  representing spins about an axis which is fixed.

* The above rules mean that in terms of memory address, the three
  velocity components of a pv-vector follow the three position
  components.  Application code is permitted to exploit this and all
  other knowledge of the internal layouts:  that x, y and z appear in
  that order and are in a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system etc.
  For example, the cp function (copy a p-vector) can be used to copy
  the velocity component of a pv-vector (indeed, this is how the
  CPV routine is coded).

* The routines provided do not completely fill the range of operations
  that link all the various vector and matrix options, but are confined
  to functions that are required by other parts of the SOFA software or
  which are likely to prove useful.

In addition to the vector/matrix routines, the library contains some
routines related to spherical angles, including conversions to and
from sexagesimal format.

Using the library requires knowledge of vector/matrix methods, spherical
trigonometry, and methods of attitude representation.  These topics are
covered in many textbooks, including "Spacecraft Attitude Determination
and Control", James R. Wertz (ed.), Astrophysics and Space Science
Library, Vol. 73, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1986.

*
*     o  Rigorous rather than approximate normalization is applied.
*
*     o  The gravitational potential term from Expr. (7) in
*        Klioner (2003) is added, taking into account only the Sun's

*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
*     others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
*         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
*         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
*     applications of this routine the choice will not be at all
*     critical.
*
*     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
*     accuracy.
*
*  2) All the vectors are with respect to BCRS axes.
*
*  3) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
*     ephemeris and CIP/CIO, the routine iau_APCI13 can be used instead
*     of the present routine.  This computes the required quantities
*     using other SOFA routines.
*
*  4) This is one of several routines that inserts into the ASTROM
*     array star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
*     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
*

*        iau_APIO iau_APIO13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
*
*     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
*     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
*     supplied by the caller.
*
*     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
*     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
*     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
*     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
*     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
*     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.

*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among

*
*            DATE1          DATE2

*         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is

*
*     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
*     accuracy.
*
*  2) The vectors EB, EH, and all the ASTROM vectors, are with respect
*     to BCRS axes.
*
*  3) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*     reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN
*     CONVENTION:  the longitude required by the present routine is
*     right-handed, i.e. east-positive, in accordance with geographical
*     convention.
*
*  4) XP and YP are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the
*     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  SP is the TIO locator
*     s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
*     Origin on the equator.  For many applications, XP, YP and
*     (especially) SP can be set to zero.
*
*     Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
*     local meridian.
*
*  5) The refraction constants REFA and REFB are for use in a
*     dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
*     (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
*     refraction.
*
*  6) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
*     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*     accordance with the models used.
*
*  7) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
*     Ephemeris, the Earth rotation information and refraction
*     constants, the routine iau_APCO13 can be used instead of the
*     present routine.  This starts from UTC and weather readings etc.
*     and computes suitable values using other SOFA routines.

*     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to

*
*     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,

*      convenient way between the two arguments, for example where UTC1
*      is the Julian Day Number and UTC2 is the fraction of a day.
*
*      However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
*      second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
*      present routine is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
*      the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
*
*      Applications should use the routine iau_DTF2D to convert from
*      calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
*      it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
*      described.
*
*  2)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*      introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
*      future to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
*
*  3)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
*      one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
*      introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
*      practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
*      essentially without limit.
*
*  4)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*      reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
*      longitude required by the present routine is east-positive
*      (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
*
*  5)  The polar motion XP,YP can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
*      values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*      Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*      Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*      meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
*      XP and YP can be set to zero.
*
*      Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto
*      the local meridian.
*
*  6)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
*      in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
*      available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
*      expression
*
*            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );
*
*      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
*      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
*      52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
*      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
*      follows:
*
*            phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
*
*      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
*      the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
*      precise work.
*
*  7)  The argument WL specifies the observing wavelength in
*      micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
*      occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).
*
*  8)  It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
*      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*      accordance with the models used.
*
*  9)  In cases where the caller wishes to supply his own Earth
*      ephemeris, Earth rotation information and refraction constants,
*      the routine iau_APCO can be used instead of the present routine.
*
*  10) This is one of several routines that inserts into the ASTROM
*      array star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
*      astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
*
*      The various routines support different classes of observer and
*      portions of the transformation chain:
*
*            routines           observer        transformation
*
*        iau_APCG iau_APCG13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS

*        iau_APIO iau_APIO13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
*
*      Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
*      compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
*      supplied by the caller.
*
*      The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
*      parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
*      comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
*      observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
*      aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
*      transformation), and atmospheric refraction.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
*     others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7           0D0       (JD method)
*         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
*         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
*     applications of this routine the choice will not be at all
*     critical.
*
*     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
*     accuracy.
*
*  2) All the vectors are with respect to BCRS axes.
*
*  3) Providing separate arguments for (i) the observer's geocentric
*     position and velocity and (ii) the Earth ephemeris is done for
*     convenience in the geocentric, terrestrial and Earth orbit cases.
*     For deep space applications it maybe more convenient to specify
*     zero geocentric position and velocity and to supply the
*     observer's position and velocity information directly instead of
*     with respect to the Earth.  However, note the different units:
*     m and m/s for the geocentric vectors, au and au/day for the
*     heliocentric and barycentric vectors.
*
*  4) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
*     ephemeris, the routine iau_APCS13 can be used instead of the
*     present routine.  This computes the Earth ephemeris using the
*     SOFA routine iau_EPV00.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 date (n.b. not UTC) UT11+UT12 is a Julian Date,
*     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments UT11 and
*     UT12.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any
*     of these ways, among others:
*
*            UT11           UT12
*
*         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
*         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
*         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
*     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum precision is
*     delivered when the UT11 argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
*     question and the UT12 argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
*     versa.
*
*  2) If the caller wishes to provide the Earth rotation angle itself,
*     the routine iau_APER can be used instead.  One use of this
*     technique is to substitute Greenwich apparent sidereal time and
*     thereby to support equinox based transformations directly.
*
*  3) This is one of several routines that inserts into the ASTROM
*     array star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
*     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) SP, the TIO locator s', is a tiny quantity needed only by the most
*     precise applications.  It can either be set to zero or predicted
*     using the SOFA routine iau_SP00.
*
*  2) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*     reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
*     longitude required by the present routine is east-positive
*     (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
*
*  3) The polar motion XP,YP can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
*     values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
*     XP and YP can be set to zero.
*
*     Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
*     local meridian.
*
*  4) The refraction constants REFA and REFB are for use in a
*     dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
*     (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
*     refraction.
*
*  5) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
*     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*     accordance with the models used.
*
*  6) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
*     rotation information and refraction constants, the routine
*     iau_APIO13 can be used instead of the present routine.  This
*     starts from UTC and weather readings etc. and computes suitable

*                                -1 = unacceptable date
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  UTC1+UTC2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
*      convenient way between the two arguments, for example where UTC1
*      is the Julian Day Number and UTC2 is the fraction of a day.
*
*      However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
*      second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
*      present routine is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
*      the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
*
*      Applications should use the routine iau_DTF2D to convert from
*      calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
*      it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
*      described.
*
*  2)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*      introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
*      to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
*
*  3)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
*      one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
*      introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
*      practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
*      essentially without limit.
*
*  4)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*      reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
*      longitude required by the present routine is east-positive
*      (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
*
*  5)  The polar motion XP,YP can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
*      values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*      Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*      Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*      meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
*      XP and YP can be set to zero.
*
*      Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto
*      the local meridian.
*
*  6)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
*      in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
*      available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
*      expression
*
*            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );
*
*      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
*      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
*      52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
*      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
*      follows:
*
*            phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
*
*      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to the
*      pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
*      precise work.
*
*  7)  The argument WL specifies the observing wavelength in
*      micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
*      occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).
*
*  8)  It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
*      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*      accordance with the models used.
*
*  9)  In cases where the caller wishes to supply his own Earth
*      rotation information and refraction constants, the routine
*      iau_APC can be used instead of the present routine.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) Star data for an epoch other than J2000.0 (for example from the
*     Hipparcos catalog, which has an epoch of J1991.25) will require a
*     preliminary call to iau_PMSAFE before use.
*
*  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
*
*  3) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.8g could be expressed in any of these ways, among
*     others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.8g           0.0       (JD method)
*         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
*         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
*     applications of this routine the choice will not be at all
*     critical.
*
*     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
*     accuracy.
*
*  4) The available accuracy is better than 1 milliarcsecond, limited
*     mainly by the precession-nutation model that is used, namely
*     IAU 2000A/2006.  Very close to solar system bodies, additional
*     errors of up to several milliarcseconds can occur because of
*     unmodeled light deflection;  however, the Sun's contribution is
*     taken into account, to first order.  The accuracy limitations of
*     the SOFA routine iau_EPV00 (used to compute Earth position and
*     velocity) can contribute aberration errors of up to
*     5 microarcseconds.  Light deflection at the Sun's limb is
*     uncertain at the 0.4 mas level.
*
*  5) Should the transformation to (equinox based) apparent place be
*     required rather than (CIO based) intermediate place, subtract the
*     equation of the origins from the returned right ascension:
*     RA = RI - EO. (The iau_ANP routine can then be applied, as
*     required, to keep the result in the conventional 0-2pi range.)

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) Star data for an epoch other than J2000.0 (for example from the
*     Hipparcos catalog, which has an epoch of J1991.25) will require a
*     preliminary call to iau_PMSAFE before use.
*
*  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
*
*  3) The array B contains N entries, one for each body to be
*     considered.  If N = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
*     applied, not even for the Sun.
*
*  4) The array B should include an entry for the Sun as well as for any
*     planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries should
*     be in the order in which the light passes the body.
*
*  5) In the entry in the B array for body I, the mass parameter B(1,I)
*     can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such effects
*     as quadrupole field.
*
*  6) The deflection limiter parameter B(2,I) is phi^2/2, where phi is
*     the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at which
*     limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen threshold,
*     the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero for phi = 0.
*     Example values suitable for a terrestrial observer, together with
*     masses, are as follows:
*
*        body I     B(1,I)         B(2,I)
*
*        Sun        1D0            6D-6

*        Saturn     0.00028574D0   3D-10
*
*  7) For efficiency, validation of the B array is omitted.  The
*     supplied masses must be greater than zero, the position and
*     velocity vectors must be right, and the deflection limiter
*     greater than zero.

*  Notes:
*
*  1)  Star data for an epoch other than J2000.0 (for example from the
*      Hipparcos catalog, which has an epoch of J1991.25) will require
*      a preliminary call to iau_PMSAFE before use.
*
*  2)  The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
*
*  3)  UTC1+UTC2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
*      convenient way between the two arguments, for example where UTC1
*      is the Julian Day Number and UTC2 is the fraction of a day.
*
*      However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
*      second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
*      present routine is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
*      the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
*
*      Applications should use the routine iau_DTF2D to convert from
*      calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
*      it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
*      described.
*
*  4)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*      introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
*      future to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
*
*  5)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
*      one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
*      introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
*      practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
*      essentially without limit.
*
*  6)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*      reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
*      longitude required by the present routine is east-positive
*      (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
*
*  7)  The polar motion XP,YP can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
*      values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*      Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*      Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*      meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
*      XP and YP can be set to zero.
*
*  8)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
*      in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB),
*      is available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from
*      the expression
*
*            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );
*
*      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
*      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
*      52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
*      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
*      follows:
*
*            phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
*
*      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
*      the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for

*  9)  The argument WL specifies the observing wavelength in
*      micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
*      occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).
*
*  10) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
*      refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
*      Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
*      there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed
*      coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
*      (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
*      than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better than
*      20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
*
*      Without refraction, the complementary routines iau_ATCO13 and
*      iau_ATOC13 are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond
*      all over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included,
*      consistency falls off at high zenith distances, but is still
*      better than 0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.
*
*  11) "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
*      perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is
*      used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
*      allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is
*      related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
*      the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
*      observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
*      angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
*      means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
*      with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.
*
*  12) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
*      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*      accordance with the models used.

*
*  Given:
*     RI,DI    d      CIRS geocentric RA,Dec (radians)
*     DATE1    d      TDB as a 2-part...
*     DATE2    d      ...Julian Date (Note 1)

*     RC,DC    d      ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)
*     EO       d      equation of the origins (ERA-GST, Note 4)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
*     others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
*         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
*         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
*     applications of this routine the choice will not be at all
*     critical.
*
*     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
*     accuracy.
*
*  2) Iterative techniques are used for the aberration and light
*     deflection corrections so that the routines iau_ATIC13 (or
*     iau_ATICQ) and iau_ATCI13 (or iau_ATCIQ) are accurate inverses;
*     even at the edge of the Sun's disk the discrepancy is only about
*     1 nanoarcsecond.
*
*  3) The available accuracy is better than 1 milliarcsecond, limited
*     mainly by the precession-nutation model that is used, namely
*     IAU 2000A/2006.  Very close to solar system bodies, additional
*     errors of up to several milliarcseconds can occur because of
*     unmodeled light deflection;  however, the Sun's contribution is
*     taken into account, to first order.  The accuracy limitations of
*     the SOFA routine iau_EPV00 (used to compute Earth position and
*     velocity) can contribute aberration errors of up to
*     5 microarcseconds.  Light deflection at the Sun's limb is
*     uncertain at the 0.4 mas level.
*
*  4) Should the transformation to (equinox based) J2000.0 mean place
*     be required rather than (CIO based) ICRS coordinates, subtract the
*     equation of the origins from the returned right ascension:
*     RA = RI - EO.  (The iau_ANP routine can then be applied, as
*     required, to keep the result in the conventional 0-2pi range.)

*  2) If the only light-deflecting body to be taken into account is the
*     Sun, the iau_ATICQ routine can be used instead.
*
*  3) The array B contains N entries, one for each body to be
*     considered.  If N = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
*     applied, not even for the Sun.
*
*  4) The array B should include an entry for the Sun as well as for any
*     planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries should
*     be in the order in which the light passes the body.
*
*  5) In the entry in the B array for body I, the mass parameter B(1,I)
*     can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such effects
*     as quadrupole field.
*
*  6) The deflection limiter parameter B(2,I) is phi^2/2, where phi is
*     the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at which
*     limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen threshold,
*     the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero for phi = 0.
*     Example values suitable for a terrestrial observer, together with
*     masses, are as follows:
*
*        body I     B(1,I)         B(2,I)

*        Sun        1D0            6D-6

*
*  7) For efficiency, validation of the contents of the B array is
*     omitted.  The supplied masses must be greater than zero, the
*     position and velocity vectors must be right, and the deflection
*     limiter greater than zero.

*                             -1 = unacceptable date
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  UTC1+UTC2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
*      convenient way between the two arguments, for example where UTC1
*      is the Julian Day Number and UTC2 is the fraction of a day.
*
*      However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
*      second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
*      present routine is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
*      the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
*
*      Applications should use the routine iau_DTF2D to convert from
*      calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
*      it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
*      described.
*
*  2)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*      introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
*      future to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
*
*  3)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
*      one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
*      introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
*      practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
*      essentially without limit.
*
*  4)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*      reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
*      longitude required by the present routine is east-positive
*      (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
*
*  5)  The polar motion XP,YP can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
*      values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*      Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*      Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*      meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
*      XP and YP can be set to zero.
*
*  6)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
*      in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
*      available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
*      expression
*
*            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );
*
*      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
*      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
*      52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
*      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
*      follows:
*
*            phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
*
*      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
*      the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
*      precise work.
*
*  7)  The argument WL specifies the observing wavelength in
*      micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
*      occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).
*
*  8)  "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
*      perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is
*      used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
*      allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is
*      related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
*      the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
*      observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
*      angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
*      means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
*      with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.
*
*  9)  The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
*      refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
*      Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
*      there are no gross local effects, the predicted astrometric
*      coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
*      (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
*      than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
*      than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
*
*  10) The complementary routines iau_ATIO13 and iau_ATOI13 are self-
*      consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all over the
*      celestial sphere.

*      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*      accordance with the models used.

*     ROB      d      observed right ascension (CIO-based, radians)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) This routine returns zenith distance rather than altitude in
*     order to reflect the fact that no allowance is made for
*     depression of the horizon.
*
*  2) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
*     refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
*     Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
*     there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed
*     coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
*     (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
*     than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better than
*     20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
*
*     Without refraction, the complementary routines iau_ATIOQ and
*     iau_ATOIQ are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all
*     over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included, consistency
*     falls off at high zenith distances, but is still better than
*     0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.
*
*  3) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
*     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*     accordance with the models used.
*
*  4) The CIRS RA,Dec is obtained from a star catalog mean place by
*     allowing for space motion, parallax, the Sun's gravitational lens
*     effect, annual aberration and precession-nutation.  For star
*     positions in the ICRS, these effects can be applied by means of
*     the iau_ATCI13 (etc.) routines.  Starting from classical "mean
*     place" systems, additional transformations will be needed first.
*
*  5) "Observed" Az,El means the position that would be seen by a
*     perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  This is obtained from
*     the CIRS RA,Dec by allowing for Earth orientation and diurnal
*     aberration, rotating from equator to horizon coordinates, and then
*     adjusting for refraction.  The HA,Dec is obtained by rotating back
*     into equatorial coordinates, and is the position that would be
*     seen by a perfect equatorial with its polar axis aligned to the
*     Earth's axis of rotation.  Finally, the RA is obtained by
*     subtracting the HA from the local ERA.
*
*  6) The star-independent CIRS-to-observed-place parameters in ASTROM
*     may be computed with iau_APIO[13] or iau_APCO[13].  If nothing has
*     changed significantly except the time, iau_APER[13] may be used
*     to perform the requisite adjustment to the ASTROM array.

*                                  -1 = unacceptable date
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
*      perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is
*      used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
*      allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is
*      related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
*      the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
*      observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
*      angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
*      means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
*      with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.
*
*  2)  Only the first character of the TYPE argument is significant.
*      'R' or 'r' indicates that OB1 and OB2 are the observed right
*      ascension and declination;  'H' or 'h' indicates that they are
*      hour angle (west +ve) and declination;  anything else ('A' or
*      'a' is recommended) indicates that OB1 and OB2 are azimuth
*      (north zero, east 90 deg) and zenith distance.
*
*  3)  UTC1+UTC2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
*      convenient way between the two arguments, for example where UTC1
*      is the Julian Day Number and UTC2 is the fraction of a day.
*
*      However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
*      second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
*      present routine is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
*      the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
*
*      Applications should use the routine iau_DTF2D to convert from
*      calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
*      it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
*      described.
*
*  4)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*      introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
*      future to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
*
*  5)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
*      one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
*      introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
*      practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
*      essentially without limit.
*
*  6)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*      reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
*      longitude required by the present routine is east-positive
*      (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
*
*  7)  The polar motion XP,YP can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
*      values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*      Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*      Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*      meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
*      XP and YP can be set to zero.
*
*  8)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
*      in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
*      available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
*      expression
*
*            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );
*
*      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
*      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
*      52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
*      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
*      follows:
*
*            phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
*
*      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
*      the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
*      precise work.
*
*  9)  The argument WL specifies the observing wavelength in
*      micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
*      occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).
*
*  10) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
*      refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
*      Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
*      there are no gross local effects, the predicted astrometric
*      coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
*      (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
*      than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
*      than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
*
*      Without refraction, the complementary routines iau_ATCO13 and
*      iau_ATOC13 are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond
*      all over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included,
*      consistency falls off at high zenith distances, but is still
*      better than 0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.
*

*      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*      accordance with the models used.

*     'a' is recommended) indicates that OB1 and OB2 are azimuth (north
*     zero, east 90 deg) and zenith distance.  (Zenith distance is used
*     rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
*     allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)
*
*  3) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
*     refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
*     Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
*     there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed
*     coordinates should be within 0D05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
*     (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
*     than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better than
*     20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
*
*     Without refraction, the complementary routines iau_ATIOQ and
*     iau_ATOIQ are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all
*     over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included, consistency
*     falls off at high zenith distances, but is still better than
*     0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.
*
*  4) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
*     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
*     accordance with the models used.
*
*  5) The star-independent astrometry parameters in ASTROM may be
*     computed with iau_APIO13 (or iau_APIO).  If nothing has changed
*     significantly except the time, iau_APER13 (or iau_APER) may be
*     used to perform the requisite adjustment to the ASTROM array.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity (radians)
*     are required in order to correct for the offset between the GCRS
*     pole and the J2000.0 mean pole.  They define, with respect to the
*     GCRS frame, a J2000.0 mean pole that is consistent with the rest
*     of the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.
*
*  2) In addition to the displacement of the pole, the complete
*     description of the frame bias requires also an offset in right
*     ascension.  This is not part of the IAU 2000A model, and is from
*     Chapront et al. (2002).  It is returned in radians.
*
*  3) This is a supplemented implementation of one aspect of the IAU
*     2000A nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly
*     in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The matrix RBPN transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator (and
*     CIO or equinox) of date.  Only the CIP (bottom row) is used.
*
*  3) The matrix RC2I is the first stage in the transformation from
*     celestial to terrestrial coordinates:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]

*     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth

*     system.  It does so starting from precomputed components, namely
*     the matrix which rotates from celestial coordinates to the
*     intermediate frame, the Earth rotation angle and the polar motion
*     matrix.  One use of the present routine is when generating a

*     Rotation Angle changes, avoiding the considerable overhead of
*     recomputing the precession-nutation more often than necessary to
*     achieve given accuracy objectives.
*
*  2) The relationship between the arguments is as follows:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
*
*               =  RC2T * [CRS]

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT and UT1 dates TTA+TTB and UTA+UTB are Julian Dates,
*     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments UTA and
*     UTB.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
*     these ways, among others:
*
*             UTA            UTB
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of UTA,UTB, the
*     date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
*     algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at least, minimum noise) is
*     delivered when the UTA argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
*     question and the UTB argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
*     versa.
*
*  2) The caller is responsible for providing the nutation components;
*     they are in longitude and obliquity, in radians and are with
*     respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  For high-accuracy
*     applications, free core nutation should be included as well as
*     any other relevant corrections to the position of the CIP.
*
*  3) XP and YP are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*     meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.
*
*  4) The matrix RC2T transforms from celestial to terrestrial
*     coordinates:
*
*        [TRS]  =  RPOM * R_3(GST) * RBPN * [CRS]
*
*               =  RC2T * [CRS]
*
*     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RBPN is the
*     bias-precession-nutation matrix, GST is the Greenwich (apparent)
*     Sidereal Time and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

*                               -1 = unacceptable date (Note 6)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) SCALE identifies the time scale.  Only the value 'UTC' (in upper
*     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
*     Note 4).
*
*  2) NDP is the number of decimal places in the seconds field, and can
*     have negative as well as positive values, such as:
*
*     NDP         resolution
*     -4            1 00 00
*     -3            0 10 00
*     -2            0 01 00
*     -1            0 00 10
*      0            0 00 01
*      1            0 00 00.1
*      2            0 00 00.01
*      3            0 00 00.001
*
*     The limits are platform dependent, but a safe range is -5 to +9.
*
*  3) D1+D2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between
*     the two arguments, for example where D1 is the Julian Day Number
*     and D2 is the fraction of a day.  In the case of UTC, where the
*     use of JD is problematical, special conventions apply:  see the
*     next note.
*
*  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
*     special measures are taken.  The SOFA internal convention is that
*     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
*     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
*     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
*     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
*     in the SOFA convention.
*
*  5) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
*     to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.

*     IHMSF     i(4)     hours, minutes, seconds, fraction
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) NDP is interpreted as follows:
*
*     NDP         resolution
*      :      ...0000 00 00
*     -7         1000 00 00
*     -6          100 00 00
*     -5           10 00 00
*     -4            1 00 00
*     -3            0 10 00
*     -2            0 01 00
*     -1            0 00 10
*      0            0 00 01
*      1            0 00 00.1
*      2            0 00 00.01
*      3            0 00 00.001
*      :            0 00 00.000...
*
*  2) The largest positive useful value for NDP is determined by the
*     size of DAYS, the format of DOUBLE PRECISION floating-point
*     numbers on the target platform, and the risk of overflowing
*     IHMSF(4).  On a typical platform, for DAYS up to 1D0, the
*     available floating-point precision might correspond to NDP=12.
*     However, the practical limit is typically NDP=9, set by the
*     capacity of a 32-bit IHMSF(4).
*
*  3) The absolute value of DAYS may exceed 1D0.  In cases where it
*     does not, it is up to the caller to test for and handle the
*     case where DAYS is very nearly 1D0 and rounds up to 24 hours,
*     by testing for IHMSF(1)=24 and setting IHMSF(1-4) to zero.

*                      -5 = internal error (Note 5)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
*     to call the routine with an earlier date.  If this is attempted,
*     zero is returned together with a warning status.
*
*     Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
*     advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
*     impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
*     after the release year of the present routine (see parameter IYV)
*     is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is returned
*     but the result is computed in the normal way.
*
*     For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is J=+1.
*     This is distinct from the error status J=-1, which signifies a
*     year so early that JD could not be computed.
*
*  2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
*     the UTC-TAI value returned is for the period leading up to the
*     leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
*     second ends, the UTC-TAI returned is for the period following the
*     leap second.
*
*  3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
*     1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
*     such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
*     routine, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.
*
*  4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the introduction
*     of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the end of 1971.
*     It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid range) even if not
*     used;  if invalid, zero is used and status J=-4 is returned.  For
*     many applications, setting FD to zero is acceptable;  the
*     resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and occurs only
*     pre-1972).
*
*  5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
*     errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
*     month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, J=-2 (bad month) will be
*     returned.  The "internal error" status refers to a case that is
*     impossible but causes some compilers to issue a warning.
*
*  6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.

*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2     d    date, TDB (Notes 1-3)
*     UT              d    universal time (UT1, fraction of one day)

*
*  Returned:
*    iau_DTDB         d    TDB-TT (seconds)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments DATE1 and DATE2.  For
*     example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these
*     ways, among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*     Although the date is, formally, barycentric dynamical time (TDB),
*     the terrestrial dynamical time (TT) can be used with no practical
*     effect on the accuracy of the prediction.
*
*  2) TT can be regarded as a coordinate time that is realized as an
*     offset of 32.184s from International Atomic Time, TAI.  TT is a
*     specific linear transformation of geocentric coordinate time TCG,
*     which is the time scale for the Geocentric Celestial Reference
*     System, GCRS.
*
*  3) TDB is a coordinate time, and is a specific linear transformation
*     of barycentric coordinate time TCB, which is the time scale for
*     the Barycentric Celestial Reference System, BCRS.
*
*  4) The difference TCG-TCB depends on the masses and positions of the
*     bodies of the solar system and the velocity of the Earth.  It is
*     dominated by a rate difference, the residual being of a periodic
*     character.  The latter, which is modeled by the present routine,
*     comprises a main (annual) sinusoidal term of amplitude
*     approximately 0.00166 seconds, plus planetary terms up to about
*     20 microseconds, and lunar and diurnal terms up to 2 microseconds.
*     These effects come from the changing transverse Doppler effect
*     and gravitational red-shift as the observer (on the Earth's
*     surface) experiences variations in speed (with respect to the
*     BCRS) and gravitational potential.
*
*  5) TDB can be regarded as the same as TCB but with a rate adjustment
*     to keep it close to TT, which is convenient for many applications.
*     The history of successive attempts to define TDB is set out in
*     Resolution 3 adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2006, which
*     defines a fixed TDB(TCB) transformation that is consistent with
*     contemporary solar-system ephemerides.  Future ephemerides will
*     imply slightly changed transformations between TCG and TCB, which
*     could introduce a linear drift between TDB and TT;  however, any
*     such drift is unlikely to exceed 1 nanosecond per century.
*
*  6) The geocentric TDB-TT model used in the present routine is that of
*     Fairhead & Bretagnon (1990), in its full form.  It was originally
*     supplied by Fairhead (private communications with P.T.Wallace,
*     1990) as a Fortran subroutine.  The present routine contains an
*     adaptation of the Fairhead code.  The numerical results are
*     essentially unaffected by the changes, the differences with
*     respect to the Fairhead & Bretagnon original being at the 1D-20 s
*     level.
*
*     The topocentric part of the model is from Moyer (1981) and
*     Murray (1983), with fundamental arguments adapted from
*     Simon et al. 1994.  It is an approximation to the expression
*     ( v / c ) . ( r / c ), where v is the barycentric velocity of
*     the Earth, r is the geocentric position of the observer and
*     c is the speed of light.
*
*     By supplying zeroes for U and V, the topocentric part of the
*     model can be nullified, and the routine will return the Fairhead
*     & Bretagnon result alone.
*
*  7) During the interval 1950-2050, the absolute accuracy is better
*     than +/- 3 nanoseconds relative to time ephemerides obtained by
*     direct numerical integrations based on the JPL DE405 solar system
*     ephemeris.
*
*  8) It must be stressed that the present routine is merely a model,
*     and that numerical integration of solar-system ephemerides is the
*     definitive method for predicting the relationship between TCG and
*     TCB and hence between TT and TDB.

*                               -6 = bad second (<0)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) SCALE identifies the time scale.  Only the value 'UTC' (in upper
*     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
*     Note 4).
*
*  2) For calendar conventions and limitations, see iau_CAL2JD.
*
*  3) The sum of the results, D1+D2, is Julian Date, where normally D1
*     is the Julian Day Number and D2 is the fraction of a day.  In the
*     case of UTC, where the use of JD is problematical, special
*     conventions apply:  see the next note.
*
*  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
*     special measures are taken.  The SOFA internal convention is that
*     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
*     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
*     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
*     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
*     in the SOFA convention.
*
*  5) The warning status "time is after end of day" usually means that
*     the SEC argument is greater than 60D0.  However, in a day ending
*     in a leap second the limit changes to 61D0 (or 59D0 in the case of
*     a negative leap second).
*
*  6) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
*     to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
*
*  7) Only in the case of continuous and regular time scales (TAI, TT,
*     TCG, TCB and TDB) is the result D1+D2 a Julian Date, strictly
*     speaking.  In the other cases (UT1 and UTC) the result must be
*     used with circumspection;  in particular the difference between
*     two such results cannot be interpreted as a precise time
*     interval.

*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The matrix is in the sense
*
*        E_ep = RM x P_ICRS,
*
*     where P_ICRS is a vector with respect to ICRS right ascension
*     and declination axes and E_ep is the same vector with respect to
*     the (inertial) ecliptic and equinox of date.
*
*  3) P_ICRS is a free vector, merely a direction, typically of unit
*     magnitude, and not bound to any particular spatial origin, such as
*     the Earth, Sun or SSB.  No assumptions are made about whether it
*     represents starlight and embodies astrometric effects such as
*     parallax or aberration.  The transformation is approximately that
*     between mean J2000.0 right ascension and declination and ecliptic
*     longitude and latitude, with only frame bias (always less than
*     25 mas) to disturb this classical picture.

*
*     with:
*
*        EE = dpsi * cos(eps)
*
*     where dpsi is the nutation in longitude and eps is the obliquity
*     of date.  However, if the rotation of the Earth were constant in
*     an inertial frame the classical formulation would lead to apparent
*     irregularities in the UT1 timescale traceable to side-effects of
*     precession-nutation.  In order to eliminate these effects from
*     UT1, "complementary terms" were introduced in 1994 (IAU, 1994) and
*     took effect from 1997 (Capitaine and Gontier, 1993):
*
*        GAST = GMST + CT + EE
*
*     By convention, the complementary terms are included as part of the
*     equation of the equinoxes rather than as part of the mean Sidereal
*     Time.  This slightly compromises the "geometrical" interpretation
*     of mean sidereal time but is otherwise inconsequential.
*
*     The present routine computes CT in the above expression,
*     compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions (Capitaine et al., 2002, and

*                              +1 = warning: date outside 1900-2100 AD
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
*     others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*     However, the accuracy of the result is more likely to be
*     limited by the algorithm itself than the way the epoch has been
*     expressed.
*
*  2) On return, the arrays PVH and PVB contain the following:
*
*        PVH(1,1)  x       }
*        PVH(2,1)  y       } heliocentric position, AU
*        PVH(3,1)  z       }
*
*        PVH(1,2)  xdot    }
*        PVH(2,2)  ydot    } heliocentric velocity, AU/d
*        PVH(3,2)  zdot    }
*
*        PVB(1,1)  x       }
*        PVB(2,1)  y       } barycentric position, AU
*        PVB(3,1)  z       }
*
*        PVB(1,2)  xdot    }
*        PVB(2,2)  ydot    } barycentric velocity, AU/d
*        PVB(3,2)  zdot    }
*
*     The vectors are with respect to the Barycentric Celestial
*     Reference System.  The time unit is one day in TDB.
*
*  3) The routine is a SIMPLIFIED SOLUTION from the planetary theory
*     VSOP2000 (X. Moisson, P. Bretagnon, 2001, Celes. Mechanics &
*     Dyn. Astron., 80, 3/4, 205-213) and is an adaptation of original
*     Fortran code supplied by P. Bretagnon (private comm., 2000).
*
*  4) Comparisons over the time span 1900-2100 with this simplified
*     solution and the JPL DE405 ephemeris give the following results:
*
*                                RMS    max
*           Heliocentric:
*              position error    3.7   11.2   km
*              velocity error    1.4    5.0   mm/s
*
*           Barycentric:
*              position error    4.6   13.4   km
*              velocity error    1.4    4.9   mm/s
*
*     Comparisons with the JPL DE406 ephemeris show that by 1800 and
*     2200 the position errors are approximately double their 1900-2100
*     size.  By 1500 and 2500 the deterioration is a factor of 10 and by
*     1000 and 3000 a factor of 60.  The velocity accuracy falls off at
*     about half that rate.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) This routine converts a star position from the FK5 system to
*     the Hipparcos system, in such a way that the Hipparcos proper
*     motion is zero.  Because such a star has, in general, a non-zero
*     proper motion in the FK5 system, the routine requires the date
*     at which the position in the FK5 system was determined.
*
*  2) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The IAU 1958 system of Galactic coordinates was defined with
*     respect to the now obsolete reference system FK4 B1950.0.  When
*     interpreting the system in a modern context, several factors have
*     to be taken into account:
*
*     . The inclusion in FK4 positions of the E-terms of aberration.
*
*     . The distortion of the FK4 proper motion system by differential
*       Galactic rotation.
*
*     . The use of the B1950.0 equinox rather than the now-standard
*       J2000.0.
*
*     . The frame bias between ICRS and the J2000.0 mean place system.
*
*     The Hipparcos Catalogue (Perryman & ESA 1997) provides a rotation
*     matrix that transforms directly between ICRS and Galactic
*     coordinates with the above factors taken into account.  The
*     matrix is derived from three angles, namely the ICRS coordinates
*     of the Galactic pole and the longitude of the ascending node of
*     the galactic equator on the ICRS equator.  They are given in
*     degrees to five decimal places and for canonical purposes are
*     regarded as exact.  In the Hipparcos Catalogue the matrix elements
*     are given to 10 decimal places (about 20 microarcsec).  In the
*     present SOFA routine the matrix elements have been recomputed from
*     the canonical three angles and are given to 30 decimal places.
*
*  2) The inverse transformation is performed by the routine iau_ICRS2G.

*
*  Returned:
*     iau_GMST00   d      Greenwich mean sidereal time (radians)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 and TT dates UTA+UTB and TTA+TTB respectively, are both
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
*     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
*     any of these ways, among others:
*
*            Part A         Part B
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
*     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
*     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
*     Rotation Angle routine, called internally:  maximum accuracy (or,
*     at least, minimum noise) is delivered when the UTA argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the UTB argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
*     and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If UT1 is used for
*     both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.
*
*  3) This GMST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
*     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible components
*     such as precession-nutation and equation of the equinoxes.
*

*  1) The UT1 and TT dates UTA+UTB and TTA+TTB respectively, are both
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
*     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
*     any of these ways, among others:
*
*            Part A         Part B
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
*     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
*     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
*     rotation angle routine, called internally:  maximum accuracy (or,
*     at least, minimum noise) is delivered when the UTA argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the UTB argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
*     and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If UT1 is used for
*     both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.
*
*  3) This GMST is compatible with the IAU 2006 precession and must not
*     be used with other precession models.
*
*  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The UT1 epoch DJ1+DJ2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments DJ1 and DJ2.  For example,
*     JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*             DJ1            DJ2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
*     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at
*     least, minimum noise) is delivered when the DJ1 argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the DJ2 argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2) The algorithm is based on the IAU 1982 expression.  This is always
*     described as giving the GMST at 0 hours UT1.  In fact, it gives the
*     difference between the GMST and the UT, the steady 4-minutes-per-day
*     drawing-ahead of ST with respect to UT.  When whole days are ignored,
*     the expression happens to equal the GMST at 0 hours UT1 each day.
*
*  3) In this routine, the entire UT1 (the sum of the two arguments DJ1
*     and DJ2) is used directly as the argument for the standard formula,
*     the constant term of which is adjusted by 12 hours to take account
*     of the noon phasing of Julian Date.  The UT1 is then added, but
*     omitting whole days to conserve accuracy.
*
*  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
*     others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
*
*  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
*     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are
*     not taken into account.
*
*  4) It was the intention that Hipparcos should be a close
*     approximation to an inertial frame, so that distant objects
*     have zero proper motion;  such objects have (in general)
*     non-zero proper motion in FK5, and this routine returns those
*     fictitious proper motions.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The IAU 1958 system of Galactic coordinates was defined with
*     respect to the now obsolete reference system FK4 B1950.0.  When
*     interpreting the system in a modern context, several factors have
*     to be taken into account:
*
*     . The inclusion in FK4 positions of the E-terms of aberration.
*
*     . The distortion of the FK4 proper motion system by differential
*       Galactic rotation.
*
*     . The use of the B1950.0 equinox rather than the now-standard
*       J2000.0.
*
*     . The frame bias between ICRS and the J2000.0 mean place system.
*
*     The Hipparcos Catalogue (Perryman & ESA 1997) provides a rotation
*     matrix that transforms directly between ICRS and Galactic
*     coordinates with the above factors taken into account.  The
*     matrix is derived from three angles, namely the ICRS coordinates
*     of the Galactic pole and the longitude of the ascending node of
*     the galactic equator on the ICRS equator.  They are given in
*     degrees to five decimal places and for canonical purposes are
*     regarded as exact.  In the Hipparcos Catalogue the matrix elements
*     are given to 10 decimal places (about 20 microarcsec).  In the
*     present SOFA routine the matrix elements have been recomputed from
*     the canonical three angles and are given to 30 decimal places.

*  Notes:

*     Expr. (7.63) in the Explanatory Supplement (Urban & Seidelmann
*     2013), with some rearrangement to minimize the effects of machine

*
*  2) The mass parameter BM can, as required, be adjusted in order to
*     allow for such effects as quadrupole field.
*
*  3) The barycentric position of the deflecting body should ideally
*     correspond to the time of closest approach of the light ray to
*     the body.
*
*  4) The deflection limiter parameter DLIM is phi^2/2, where phi is the
*     angular separation (in radians) between source and body at which
*     limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen threshold,
*     the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero for phi = 0.
*
*  5) The returned vector P1 is not normalized, but the consequential

*
*  6) To accumulate total light deflection taking into account the

*
*  1) The array B contains N entries, one for each body to be
*     considered.  If N = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
*     applied, not even for the Sun.
*
*  2) The array B should include an entry for the Sun as well as for any
*     planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries should
*     be in the order in which the light passes the body.
*
*  3) In the entry in the B array for body I, the mass parameter B(1,I)
*     can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such effects
*     as quadrupole field.
*
*  4) The deflection limiter parameter B(2,I) is phi^2/2, where phi is
*     the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at which
*     limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen threshold,
*     the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero for phi = 0.
*     Example values suitable for a terrestrial observer, together with
*     masses, are as follows:

*        Saturn     0.00028574D0   3D-10
*
*  5) For cases where the starlight passes the body before reaching the
*     observer, the body is placed back along its barycentric track by
*     the light time from that point to the observer.  For cases where
*     the body is "behind" the observer no such shift is applied.  If
*     a different treatment is preferred, the user has the option of
*     instead using the iau_LD routine.  Similarly, iau_LD can be used
*     for cases where the source is nearby, not a star.
*
*  6) The returned vector SN is not normalized, but the consequential
*     departure from unit magnitude is always negligible.
*
*  7) For efficiency, validation is omitted.  The supplied masses must

*
*  Nutation, IAU 2000A model (MHB2000 luni-solar and planetary nutation
*  with free core nutation omitted).
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2   d    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     DPSI,DEPS     d    nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
*     and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
*     obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977)
*     value of 84381.448 arcsec.
*
*     Both the luni-solar and planetary nutations are included.  The
*     latter are due to direct planetary nutations and the perturbations
*     of the lunar and terrestrial orbits.
*
*  3) The routine computes the MHB2000 nutation series with the
*     associated corrections for planetary nutations.  It is an
*     implementation of the nutation part of the IAU 2000A precession-
*     nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
*     2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002), but with the free core
*     nutation (FCN - see Note 4) omitted.
*
*  4) The full MHB2000 model also contains contributions to the
*     nutations in longitude and obliquity due to the free-excitation of
*     the free-core-nutation during the period 1979-2000.  These FCN
*     terms, which are time-dependent and unpredictable, are NOT
*     included in the present routine and, if required, must be
*     independently computed.  With the FCN corrections included, the
*     present routine delivers a pole which is at current epochs
*     accurate to a few hundred microarcseconds.  The omission of FCN
*     introduces further errors of about that size.
*
*  5) The present routine provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000
*     algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the
*     offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments
*     in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates.
*     These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession
*     adjustments, are supported by the SOFA routines iau_BI00 and
*     iau_PR00.
*
*  6) The MHB2000 algorithm also provides "total" nutations, comprising
*     the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments,
*     luni-solar nutation and planetary nutation.  These total nutations
*     can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976 precession
*     implementation, such as iau_PMAT76, to deliver GCRS-to-true
*     predictions of sub-mas accuracy at current epochs.  However, there
*     are three shortcomings in the MHB2000 model that must be taken
*     into account if more accurate or definitive results are required
*     (see Wallace 2002):
*
*       (i) The MHB2000 total nutations are simply arithmetic sums,
*           yet in reality the various components are successive Euler
*           rotations.  This slight lack of rigor leads to cross terms
*           that exceed 1 mas after a century.  The rigorous procedure
*           is to form the GCRS-to-true rotation matrix by applying the
*           bias, precession and nutation in that order.
*
*      (ii) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with
*           respect to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does
*           not specify which set of Euler angles are to be used and
*           how the adjustments are to be applied.  The most literal and
*           straightforward procedure is to adopt the 4-rotation
*           epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and to add DPSIPR to
*           psi_A and DEPSPR to both omega_A and eps_A.
*
*     (iii) The MHB2000 model predates the determination by Chapront
*           et al. (2002) of a 14.6 mas displacement between the J2000.0
*           mean equinox and the origin of the ICRS frame.  It should,
*           however, be noted that neglecting this displacement when
*           calculating star coordinates does not lead to a 14.6 mas
*           change in right ascension, only a small second-order
*           distortion in the pattern of the precession-nutation effect.
*
*     For these reasons, the SOFA routines do not generate the "total
*     nutations" directly, though they can of course easily be generated
*     by calling iau_BI00, iau_PR00 and the present routine and adding
*     the results.
*
*  7) The MHB2000 model contains 41 instances where the same frequency
*     appears multiple times, of which 38 are duplicates and three are
*     triplicates.  To keep the present code close to the original MHB
*     algorithm, this small inefficiency has not been corrected.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any

*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*

*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
*     and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
*     obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977)
*     value of 84381.448 arcsec.  (The errors that result from using
*     this routine with the IAU 2006 value of 84381.406 arcsec can be
*     neglected.)
*
*     The nutation model consists only of luni-solar terms, but includes
*     also a fixed offset which compensates for certain long-period
*     planetary terms (Note 7).
*
*  3) This routine is an implementation of the IAU 2000B abridged
*     nutation model formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
*     2000.  The routine computes the MHB_2000_SHORT luni-solar nutation
*     series (Luzum 2001), but without the associated corrections for
*     the precession rate adjustments and the offset between the GCRS
*     and J2000.0 mean poles.
*
*  4) The full IAU 2000A (MHB2000) nutation model contains nearly 1400
*     terms.  The IAU 2000B model (McCarthy & Luzum 2003) contains only
*     77 terms, plus additional simplifications, yet still delivers
*     results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs.  This combination of
*     accuracy and size makes the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model
*     suitable for most practical applications.
*
*     The routine delivers a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100
*     (usually better than 1 mas, very occasionally just outside 1 mas).
*     The full IAU 2000A model, which is implemented in the routine
*     iau_NUT00A (q.v.), delivers considerably greater accuracy at
*     current epochs;  however, to realize this improved accuracy,
*     corrections for the essentially unpredictable free-core-nutation
*     (FCN) must also be included.
*
*  5) The present routine provides classical nutation.  The
*     MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also
*     with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the
*     adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed
*     precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias
*     and precession adjustments, are supported by the SOFA routines
*     iau_BI00 and iau_PR00.
*
*  6) The MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm also provides "total" nutations,
*     comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession
*     adjustments, and nutation (luni-solar + planetary).  These total
*     nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976
*     precession implementation, such as iau_PMAT76, to deliver GCRS-to-
*     true predictions of mas accuracy at current epochs.  However, for
*     symmetry with the iau_NUT00A routine (q.v. for the reasons), the
*     SOFA routines do not generate the "total nutations" directly.
*     Should they be required, they could of course easily be generated
*     by calling iau_BI00, iau_PR00 and the present routine and adding
*     the results.
*
*  7) The IAU 2000B model includes "planetary bias" terms that are fixed
*     in size but compensate for long-period nutations.  The amplitudes
*     quoted in McCarthy & Luzum (2003), namely Dpsi = -1.5835 mas and
*     Depsilon = +1.6339 mas, are optimized for the "total nutations"
*     method described in Note 6.  The Luzum (2001) values used in this
*     SOFA implementation, namely -0.135 mas and +0.388 mas, are
*     optimized for the "rigorous" method, where frame bias, precession
*     and nutation are applied separately and in that order.  During the
*     interval 1995-2050, the SOFA implementation delivers a maximum
*     error of 1.001 mas (not including FCN).

*      PSI    psi_J2000   longitude difference of equator poles, J2000.0
*
*     The returned values are all radians.
*
*  3) Hilton et al. (2006) Table 1 also contains angles that depend on
*     models distinct from the P03 precession theory itself, namely the
*     IAU 2000A frame bias and nutation.  The quoted polynomials are
*     used in other SOFA routines:
*
*     . iau_XY06 contains the polynomial parts of the X and Y series.
*
*     . iau_S06 contains the polynomial part of the s+XY/2 series.
*
*     . iau_PFW06 implements the series for the Fukushima-Williams
*       angles that are with respect to the GCRS pole (i.e. the variants
*       that include frame bias).
*
*  4) The IAU resolution stipulated that the choice of parameterization
*     was left to the user, and so an IAU compliant precession
*     implementation can be constructed using various combinations of
*     the angles returned by the present routine.
*
*  5) The parameterization used by SOFA is the version of the Fukushima-
*     Williams angles that refers directly to the GCRS pole.  These
*     angles may be calculated by calling the routine iau_PFW06.  SOFA
*     also supports the direct computation of the CIP GCRS X,Y by
*     series, available by calling iau_XY06.
*
*  6) The agreement between the different parameterizations is at the
*     1 microarcsecond level in the present era.
*
*  7) When constructing a precession formulation that refers to the GCRS
*     pole rather than the dynamical pole, it may (depending on the
*     choice of angles) be necessary to introduce the frame bias
*     explicitly.

*     BTHETA        d    2nd rotation: radians counterclockwise around y
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments DATE1 and DATE2.  For
*     example, JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these
*     ways, among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2

*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)

*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The traditional accumulated precession angles zeta_A, z_A, theta_A
*     cannot be obtained in the usual way, namely through polynomial
*     expressions, because of the frame bias.  The latter means that two
*     of the angles undergo rapid changes near this date.  They are
*     instead the results of decomposing the precession-bias matrix
*     obtained by using the Fukushima-Williams method, which does not
*     suffer from the problem.  The decomposition returns values which
*     can be used in the conventional formulation and which include
*     frame bias.
*
*  3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
*     is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler rotations.
*     The precession-bias matrix is R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).
*
*  4) Should zeta_A, z_A, theta_A angles be required that do not contain
*     frame bias, they are available by calling the SOFA routine

*
*  4) The matrix representing the combined effects of frame bias,
*     precession and nutation is simply:
*
*        NxPxB = R_1(-EPSA-dE).R_3(-PSIB-dP).R_1(PHIB).R_3(GAMB)
*
*     where dP and dE are the nutation components with respect to the
*     ecliptic of date.

*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Approximate heliocentric position and velocity of a nominated major
*  planet:  Mercury, Venus, EMB, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or
*  Neptune (but not the Earth itself).
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1    d       TDB date part A (Note 1)
*     DATE2    d       TDB date part B (Note 1)
*     NP       i       planet (1=Mercury, 2=Venus, 3=EMB ... 8=Neptune)

*                              +2 = warning: solution failed to converge
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TDB date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
*     others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*     The limited accuracy of the present algorithm is such that any
*     of the methods is satisfactory.
*
*  2) If an NP value outside the range 1-8 is supplied, an error
*     status (J = -1) is returned and the PV vector set to zeroes.
*
*  3) For NP=3 the result is for the Earth-Moon Barycenter.  To
*     obtain the heliocentric position and velocity of the Earth,
*     use instead the SOFA routine iau_EPV00.
*
*  4) On successful return, the array PV contains the following:
*
*        PV(1,1)  x       }
*        PV(2,1)  y       } heliocentric position, AU
*        PV(3,1)  z       }
*
*        PV(1,2)  xdot    }
*        PV(2,2)  ydot    } heliocentric velocity, AU/d
*        PV(3,2)  zdot    }
*
*     The reference frame is equatorial and is with respect to the
*     mean equator and equinox of epoch J2000.0.
*
*  5) The algorithm is due to J.L. Simon, P. Bretagnon, J. Chapront,
*     M. Chapront-Touze, G. Francou and J. Laskar (Bureau des
*     Longitudes, Paris, France).  From comparisons with JPL
*     ephemeris DE102, they quote the following maximum errors
*     over the interval 1800-2050:
*
*                     L (arcsec)    B (arcsec)      R (km)
*
*        Mercury          4             1             300
*        Venus            5             1             800
*        EMB              6             1            1000
*        Mars            17             1            7700
*        Jupiter         71             5           76000
*        Saturn          81            13          267000
*        Uranus          86             7          712000
*        Neptune         11             1          253000
*
*     Over the interval 1000-3000, they report that the accuracy is no
*     worse than 1.5 times that over 1800-2050.  Outside 1000-3000 the
*     accuracy declines.
*
*     Comparisons of the present routine with the JPL DE200 ephemeris
*     give the following RMS errors over the interval 1960-2025:
*
*                      position (km)     velocity (m/s)
*
*        Mercury            334               0.437
*        Venus             1060               0.855
*        EMB               2010               0.815
*        Mars              7690               1.98
*        Jupiter          71700               7.70
*        Saturn          199000              19.4
*        Uranus          564000              16.4
*        Neptune         158000              14.4
*
*     Comparisons against DE200 over the interval 1800-2100 gave the
*     following maximum absolute differences.  (The results using
*     DE406 were essentially the same.)
*
*                   L (arcsec)   B (arcsec)     R (km)   Rdot (m/s)
*
*        Mercury        7            1            500       0.7
*        Venus          7            1           1100       0.9
*        EMB            9            1           1300       1.0
*        Mars          26            1           9000       2.5
*        Jupiter       78            6          82000       8.2
*        Saturn        87           14         263000      24.6

*        Neptune       11            2         248000      21.4
*
*  6) The present SOFA re-implementation of the original Simon et al.
*     Fortran code differs from the original in the following respects:
*
*       *  The date is supplied in two parts.
*
*       *  The result is returned only in equatorial Cartesian form;
*          the ecliptic longitude, latitude and radius vector are not
*          returned.
*
*       *  The result is in the J2000.0 equatorial frame, not ecliptic.
*
*       *  More is done in-line:  there are fewer calls to other
*          routines.
*
*       *  Different error/warning status values are used.
*
*       *  A different Kepler's-equation-solver is used (avoiding
*          use of COMPLEX*16).
*
*       *  Polynomials in T are nested to minimize rounding errors.
*
*       *  Explicit double-precision constants are used to avoid
*          mixed-mode expressions.
*
*       *  There are other, cosmetic, changes to comply with SOFA
*          style conventions.
*
*     None of the above changes affects the result significantly.
*
*  7) The returned status, J, indicates the most serious condition
*     encountered during execution of the routine.  Illegal NP is
*     considered the most serious, overriding failure to converge,
*     which in turn takes precedence over the remote epoch warning.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The starting and ending TDB epochs EP1A+EP1B and EP2A+EP2B are
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
*     parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
*     expressed in any of these ways, among others:
*
*             EPnA          EPnB
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
*     good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*     The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
*     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
*     Julian year.
*
*     The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds.
*
*  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
*     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
*     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
*     before use.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is
*     assumed.
*
*  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is overridden to
*     ensure that the object is at a finite but very large distance, but
*     not so large that the proper motion is equivalent to a large but
*     safe speed (about 0.1c using the chosen constant).  A warning
*     status of 1 is added to the status if this action has been taken.
*
*  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
*     constant VMAX in the routine iau_STARPV), it is arbitrarily set to
*     zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.
*
*  8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the iau_STARPV routine
*     involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
*     converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
*     status.

*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The precession adjustments are expressed as "nutation components",
*     corrections in longitude and obliquity with respect to the J2000.0
*     equinox and ecliptic.
*
*  3) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with respect
*     to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does not specify which
*     set of Euler angles are to be used and how the adjustments are to
*     be applied.  The most literal and straightforward procedure is to
*     adopt the 4-rotation epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and
*     to add DPSIPR to psi_A and DEPSPR to both omega_A and eps_A.
*
*  4) This is an implementation of one aspect of the IAU 2000A nutation
*     model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000,
*     namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

*  IAU 1976 precession model.
*
*  This routine forms the three Euler angles which implement general
*  precession between two dates, using the IAU 1976 model (as for
*  the FK5 catalog).
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE01,DATE02  d   TDB starting date (Note 1)
*     DATE11,DATE12  d   TDB ending date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     ZETA           d   1st rotation: radians clockwise around z
*     Z              d   3rd rotation: radians clockwise around z
*     THETA          d   2nd rotation: radians counterclockwise around y
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The dates DATE01+DATE02 and DATE11+DATE12 are Julian Dates,
*     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments DATEn1 and
*     DATEn2.  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any
*     of these ways, among others:
*
*           DATEn1         DATEn2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
*     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
*     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
*     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*     The two dates may be expressed using different methods, but at
*     the risk of losing some resolution.
*
*  2) The accumulated precession angles zeta, z, theta are expressed
*     through canonical polynomials which are valid only for a limited
*     time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976 precession rate is known to
*     be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy of the present formulation is
*     better than 0.1 arcsec from 1960AD to 2040AD, better than 1 arcsec
*     from 1640AD to 2360AD, and remains below 3 arcsec for the whole of
*     the period 500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed 10 arcsec outside
*     the range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec outside 4200BC to
*     5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to 8200AD.
*
*  3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
*     is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler rotations.
*     The precession matrix is R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).

*                          -2 = null position vector
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The specified pv-vector is the coordinate direction (and its rate
*     of change) for the epoch at which the light leaving the star
*     reached the solar-system barycenter.
*
*  2) The star data returned by this routine are "observables" for an
*     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
*     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
*     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
*     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
*     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
*     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-
*     velocity data;  moreover, the supplied pv-vector is likely to be
*     merely an intermediate result (for example generated by the
*     routine iau_STARPV), so that a change of time unit will cancel
*     out overall.
*
*     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*     Summarizing, the specified pv-vector is for most stars almost
*     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
*     "space motion" transformation to the catalog data.  The
*     differences, which are the subject of the Stumpff paper cited
*     below, are:
*
*     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
*     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
*     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
*     effect.
*
*     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
*     the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.
*
*  4) The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
*     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per Julian
*     year.  The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not
*     true angle, and will thus be numerically larger at high
*     declinations.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed in the inertial frame is
*     assumed.  If the speed is greater than or equal to the speed of
*     light, the routine aborts with an error status.
*
*  6) The inverse transformation is performed by the routine iau_STARPV.

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The terrestrial coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
*     reference ellipsoid.
*
*  2) XP and YP are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
*     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
*     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
*     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  SP is the TIO locator
*     s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
*     Origin on the equator.  For many applications, XP, YP and
*     (especially) SP can be set to zero.
*
*  3) If THETA is Greenwich apparent sidereal time instead of Earth
*     rotation angle, the result is with respect to the true equator
*     and equinox of date, i.e. with the x-axis at the equinox rather
*     than the celestial intermediate origin.
*
*  4) The velocity units are meters per UT1 second, not per SI second.
*     This is unlikely to have any practical consequences in the modern
*     era.
*
*  5) No validation is performed on the arguments.  Error cases that

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The model balances speed and accuracy to give good results in
*     applications where performance at low altitudes is not paramount.
*     Performance is maintained across a range of conditions, and
*     applies to both optical/IR and radio.
*
*  2) The model omits the effects of (i) height above sea level (apart
*     from the reduced pressure itself), (ii) latitude (i.e. the
*     flattening of the Earth), (iii) variations in tropospheric lapse
*     rate and (iv) dispersive effects in the radio.
*
*     The model was tested using the following range of conditions:
*
*       lapse rates 0.0055, 0.0065, 0.0075 deg/meter
*       latitudes 0, 25, 50, 75 degrees
*       heights 0, 2500, 5000 meters ASL
*       pressures mean for height -10% to +5% in steps of 5%
*       temperatures -10 deg to +20 deg with respect to 280 deg at SL
*       relative humidity 0, 0.5, 1
*       wavelengths 0.4, 0.6, ... 2 micron, + radio
*       zenith distances 15, 45, 75 degrees
*
*     The accuracy with respect to raytracing through a model
*     atmosphere was as follows:
*
*                            worst         RMS
*
*       optical/IR           62 mas       8 mas
*       radio               319 mas      49 mas
*
*     For this particular set of conditions:
*
*       lapse rate 0.0065 K/meter
*       latitude 50 degrees
*       sea level
*       pressure 1005 mb
*       temperature 280.15 K
*       humidity 80%
*       wavelength 5740 Angstroms

*
*     The values for Saastamoinen's formula (which includes terms
*     up to tan^5) are taken from Hohenkerk and Sinclair (1985).
*
*  3) A WL value in the range 0-100 selects the optical/IR case and is
*     wavelength in micrometers.  Any value outside this range selects
*     the radio case.
*
*  4) Outlandish input parameters are silently limited to mathematically
*     safe values.  Zero pressure is permissible, and causes zeroes to
*     be returned.
*
*  5) The algorithm draws on several sources, as follows:
*
*     a) The formula for the saturation vapour pressure of water as
*        a function of temperature and temperature is taken from
*        Equations (A4.5-A4.7) of Gill (1982).
*
*     b) The formula for the water vapour pressure, given the
*        saturation pressure and the relative humidity, is from
*        Crane (1976), Equation (2.5.5).
*
*     c) The refractivity of air is a function of temperature,
*        total pressure, water-vapour pressure and, in the case
*        of optical/IR, wavelength.  The formulae for the two cases are
*        developed from Hohenkerk & Sinclair (1985) and Rueger (2002).
*
*     d) The formula for beta, the ratio of the scale height of the
*        atmosphere to the geocentric distance of the observer, is
*        an adaption of Equation (9) from Stone (1996).  The
*        adaptations, arrived at empirically, consist of (i) a small
*        adjustment to the coefficient and (ii) a humidity term for the
*        radio case only.
*
*     e) The formulae for the refraction constants as a function of
*        n-1 and beta are from Green (1987), Equation (4.31).

*  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
*     of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
*     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
*     CIP equator.  The CIO locator s remains a small fraction of

*
*  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
*     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series is
*     more compact than a direct series for s would be.  The present
*     routine uses the IAU 2000B truncated nutation model when
*     predicting the CIP position.  The routine iau_S00A uses instead

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The starting and ending TDB epochs EP1A+EP1B and EP2A+EP2B are
*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
*     parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
*     expressed in any of these ways, among others:
*
*             EPnA          EPnB
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*     The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
*     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
*     Julian year.
*
*     The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds.
*
*  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
*     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
*     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
*     before use.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
*     is assumed.
*
*  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
*     to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
*     of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the iau_STARPV routine
*     for the value used).  When the distance is overridden in this way,
*     the status, initially zero, has 1 added to it.
*
*  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
*     constant VMAX in the routine iau_STARPV), it is arbitrarily set to
*     zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.
*
*  8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the iau_STARPV routine
*     involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
*     converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
*     status.

*                        else = binary logical OR of the above
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The star data accepted by this routine are "observables" for an
*     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
*     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
*     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
*     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
*     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
*     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-
*     velocity data;  moreover, the pv-vector is likely to be merely an
*     intermediate result, so that a change of time unit would cancel
*     out overall.
*
*     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
*     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
*     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
*     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
*
*  2) The resulting position and velocity pv-vector is with respect to
*     the same frame and, like the catalog coordinates, is freed from
*     the effects of secular aberration.  Should the "coordinate
*     direction", where the object was located at the catalog epoch, be
*     required, it may be obtained by calculating the magnitude of the
*     position vector PV(1-3,1) dividing by the speed of light in AU/day
*     to give the light-time, and then multiplying the space velocity
*     PV(1-3,2) by this light-time and adding the result to PV(1-3,1).
*
*     Summarizing, the pv-vector returned is for most stars almost
*     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
*     "space motion" transformation.  The differences, which are the
*     subject of the Stumpff paper referenced below, are:
*
*     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
*     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
*     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
*     effect.
*
*     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
*
*  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
*     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
*     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
*     the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.
*
*  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
*     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
*     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
*     before use.
*
*  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
*     is assumed.
*
*  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
*     to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
*     of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the constant PXMIN).
*     When the distance is overridden in this way, the status, initially
*     zero, has 1 added to it.
*
*  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
*     constant VMAX), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action
*     occurs, 2 is added to the status.
*
*  8) The relativistic adjustment involves an iterative calculation.
*     If the process fails to converge within a set number (IMAX) of
*     iterations, 4 is added to the status.
*
*  9) The inverse transformation is performed by the routine iau_PVSTAR.
*
*  Called:
*     iau_S2PV     spherical coordinates to pv-vector
*     iau_PM       modulus of p-vector

*  on IAU 2006 precession and IAU 2000A nutation.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.

*

*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The X,Y coordinates are those of the unit vector towards the
*     celestial intermediate pole.  They represent the combined effects
*     of frame bias, precession and nutation.
*
*  3) The fundamental arguments used are as adopted in IERS Conventions
*     (2003) and are from Simon et al. (1994) and Souchay et al. (1999).
*
*  4) This is an alternative to the angles-based method, via the SOFA
*     routine iau_FW2XY and as used in iau_XYS06A for example.  The
*     two methods agree at the 1 microarcsecond level (at present),
*     a negligible amount compared with the intrinsic accuracy of the
*     models.  However, it would be unwise to mix the two methods
*     (angles-based and series-based) in a single application.
