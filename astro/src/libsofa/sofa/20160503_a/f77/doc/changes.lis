                   Updates for SOFA Release 12 : 2016 May
                   -------------------------------------- 

Changes/updates fall into the following categories:

1. The addition of four routines to the Precession/Nutation/Polar Motion
   section, which deliver long-term (+/-200,000 years) precession using
   the model of Vondrak, Capitaine and Wallace (2011, 2012).

2. Introduction of a new section entitled Ecliptic Coordinates.  This
   section consists of six routines dealing with the transformation
   between equatorial and ecliptic coordinates using either the IAU 2006
   precession model or the long-term precession model of Vondrak et al.

3. Separate Earth Attitude Cookbooks for Fortran and C users, replacing
   the existing Fortran-only edition.

4. Some documentation corrections.

Summary of Changes
------------------

Changes/updates for this minor release (12a) fall into the following 
categories:

1. A leap second at the end of December 2016, requires updates to the
   iau_DAT (dat.for) and iauDat (Dat.c) routines.  The test-bed        
   programs t_sofa_f.for and t_sofa_c.c are also updated to test this 
   change.
   
2. The routines iau_LDSUN and iauLdsun, that calculate the deflection 
   of starlight by the Sun, have changed, though without affecting 
   the results for normal use.  As a defensive measure, an internal 
   threshold value tapers off the returned value for cases close to 
   the center of the solar disk so that it becomes zero rather than
   infinity at the center.  By making the formerly fixed threshold 
   value depend on observer location, it has been possible to make 
   the onset of the defensive measure less abrupt, which has greatly 
   improved round-trip closure even for impossible (i.e. occulted) 
   cases.  For a terrestrial observer, the new threshold corresponds 
   to a distance of about 5 arcminutes (formerly 9 arcseconds) from 
   the center of the disk.     
 
3. Documentation updates and corrections.

             DLIM = 1D-6 / MAX(EM*EM,1D0) and EM is the dstance in au
             from the Sun to the observer.
