*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     DATE1,DATE2    d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     iau_EE00A      d      equation of the equinoxes (Note 2)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The TT date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
*     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*            DATE1          DATE2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
*
*  2) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:
*
*        Greenwich apparent ST = GMST + equation of the equinoxes
*
*  3) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions.  For
*     further details, see IERS Conventions 2003 and Capitaine et al.
*     (2002).
